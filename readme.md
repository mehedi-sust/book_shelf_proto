# Book Shelf Proto

This repository contains the protocol buffer (proto) file for the gRPC Book Service.

## Overview

The Book Service is a gRPC-based service that allows users to manage books. The proto file defines the service methods and message types used by the service.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Book Service proto, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehedi-sust/book_shelf_proto.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies, such as the protocol buffer compiler (protoc), if not already installed.

3. Build the gRPC code from the proto file. Use the following command to generate the code:
   ```bash
   protoc --proto_path=./ --python_out=./ book.proto
   ```

4. You can now use the generated code in your gRPC server and client applications. You can check [Book Shelf Django gRPC](https://github.com/mehedi-sust/book_shelf_django_gRPC.git)
